# Step 1: Check For Code Comment Needs

Use `CONTEXT.md` and `STATE.json` to understand the project purpose, entry points, and critical paths. Review core files (notably `src/lyco_image_mosaic/cli.py`, `src/lyco_image_mosaic/launcher.py`, and `tools/`) and identify areas where brief, high-signal comments are needed to clarify complex logic, non-obvious decisions, or edge cases. Do not add redundant comments. Prefer concise comments just above the block they explain.

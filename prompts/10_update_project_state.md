# Step 10: Update Project Context And State

Review recent changes and update project references accordingly:
- `CONTEXT.md` for purpose, run modes, structure, packaging, and docs map.
- `STATE.json` for paths, commands, decisions, and roadmap alignment.
- `TASKS.md` for phased roadmap and any new requirements.
- `prompts/CI_CD_TASKS.md` if the checklist changes.

Keep updates concise and consistent with the current repository structure.
